dataset taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds

Note:
Initially the dataset has 2 subfolders: set_a and set_b containing different types of heartbeat audios.
From these, I have created "normal" and "abnormal" subfolders.
"normal" subfolder contains all the heartbeat audios that are labelled as normal
"abnormal" subfolder contains all the heartbeat audios that are labelled as murmur, extrahls, extrastole
